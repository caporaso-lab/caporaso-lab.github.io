    <p>We are a <a href="https://qiime2.org" target="_blank">bioinformatics software engineering</a> lab interested
        in applications of microbiome science in cancer prevention, cancer treatment, and environmental sustainability.</p>
    <p>We additionally lead activities focused on
        <a href="https://readIAB.org" target="_blank">bioinformatics education</a> and
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/qiime2" target="_blank">training</a>, and
        <a href="https://four-corners-scientific-computing.org" target="_blank">increasing diversity and inclusion in scientific computing</a>.</p>
    <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/qiime2/" target="_blank">software</a> and
        <a href="https://docs.qiime2.org/jupyterbooks/cancer-microbiome-intervention-tutorial/" target="_blank">educational content</a> are free
        and open source, and we're committed to
        <a href="https://forum.qiime2.org" target="_blank">increasing accessibility and building community</a>
        around <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11198" target="_blank">reproducible bioinformatics</a> and microbiome science.</p>
