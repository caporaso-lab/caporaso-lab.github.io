# QIIME 2 Support
If you're looking for help with QIIME 2, please visit the [QIIME 2 Forum](https://forum.qiime2.org). Start by searching to see if your question has already been answered, and if not feel free to create a new post. It's free!

Requesting help on the QIIME 2 Forum is generally quicker than contacting the developers directly. We sometimes lose track of our email, but multiple moderators are always tracking posts on the Forum.

# q2-jobs: the QIIME 2 Forum Job Board
The Caporaso Lab is often hiring, and all of our positions (and others) are advertised on [q2-jobs, the QIIME 2 Forum Job Board](https://forum.qiime2.org/c/q2-jobs).
Caporaso Lab position types include research software engineers, post-doctoral scholars, graduate research assistants, writers, project managers, and administrative assistants.

**If you'd like to advertise an open position**, you can post to [q2-jobs](https://forum.qiime2.org/c/q2-jobs). We just ask that posts are restricted to jobs relevant to the QIIME 2 user and developer community.

Undergraduates interested in positions should review our [undergraduate job information](/undergrad/).

# Finding the Caporaso Lab
The Caporaso Lab is located in Suite 220 of the Applied Research and Development (ARD) building at Northern Arizona University (see map below).

Dr. Caporaso's office is located in Room 225 of ARD, which is at the northwest corner of Suite 220.
